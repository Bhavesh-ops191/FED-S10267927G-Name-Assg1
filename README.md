# Your Project's Name

My project is about selling merch for a K-Pop band called "Le sserafim"
Firstly people might not know who Le sserafim are, Thus, in the home page, there is a big picture with the crew
about us page so that people know who they are with a slideshow showing iconic moments they share
and also a members tab with the details of each member so people can get close to the individual members

Finally, a merch tab to actually sell the merch.
You can also play music in the background to change the mood and adjust volume and skip songs.
However, on the merch page, the volume and song menue is removed so that the entire focus is on the merch itself.
the music should still play, However it may not be functional for some devices.
 
## Design Process
 
This website is for people who want to know more about upcoming k-pop artists and to influence them to buy merch from our page.

- As a consumer who may be a fan of K-Pop, I want to purchase merch for le sserafim, for collections or just use their merch for daily use.

## Features

Firstly, a navigation bar for easy access to my pages

animations when hovering over the different ttabs

there is a music player at the bottom left to shuffle between music

a volume slider at the bottom left

in the about me section, there is a slideshow showing teases of characters (not that important)

and right below it it shows the full pictures of the members with their details and clickable image to their wiki

in the merch page there is a search menu where you can search for merch or also filter based on catogeries

if status is sold out in the js file, it will appear as sold out

for example purposes 2 merch can be clicked with adjusting quantities based on the max quanitity and buying them corresponding to wether the item is sold out or not

as for moblie verison, the home icon is removed for a more clean navigation tab and every webpage still works removing not improtant things and shrinking the music player

for the volume adjusting, it is removed for mobile as the user would not have multiple tabs on mobile and they can use their phone volume system itself

add to cart

instead of using a music player, use a small circled disk where when u click, it will expand to the music player

option to change currency and everything will change accordingly

Contact us : insta, handles ect

animation for button press

## Technologies Used

HTML: for the main frame of the website
CSS: styling the website
JS: play music and control sound, add quantity, store data ect.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Music player:
    1. Try to skip to the end many times and see if there is a error, or it loops
    2. Try to pause and play and see if it resumes on the same position
    3. try to skip and see if music plays from the start

1. Merch items:
    1. try to add more than the max quantity labeled
    2. try to buy item even if there is no stock

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

In the navigation bar, home icon is removed and rest of the items are aligned to make it feel more clean
the text in the image stays aligned to the center and everything else is also aligned
music player shrinks and volume slider disappears as there is no need for one on a phone
in the members section, the slideshow is removed as it was only made as a teaser but the important details of each member stays
and the image and text shrink proportionately to window size
for merch, everything remains centered including the categories and items and should work normally
for each item, flex-direction changes to column and the image appears above the text

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
My Volume slider was not working 
button logos were jagged
start time does not change based on the music
music player did not go bottom left
on the homepage, when hovering over the big text, image didnt darken
music doesnt play when change tab for some devices although code is perfectly correct

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
